   <b>Why has the debt threshold increased from $100,000 to $150,000 under the Debt Repayment Scheme?</b><br><br>
   The primary objective of increasing the debt threshold from $100,000 to $150,000 is to allow more debtors to be eligible for the Debt Repayment Scheme. This allows debtors to avoid the stigma of bankruptcy and its restrictions whilst continuing to service their debts.
