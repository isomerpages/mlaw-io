**QUESTIONS & ANSWERS RELATING TO THE INSOLVENCY, RESTRUCTURING & DISSOLUTION ACT 2018 (No. 40 of 2018) ("IRDA")**<br>

**1. Are there any changes to the role of the Official Receiver under the IRDA?**<br>

Under the IRDA, the Official Receiver will no longer be the liquidator of last resort and will administer new compulsory winding up cases only if the Official Receiver consents to doing so.<br>

**2. What is the threshold for commencing a winding up application against a debtor under IRDA?**<br>

Pursuant to section 125(2)(a) of the IRDA, the threshold for indebtedness has been increased from $10,000 to $15,000.<br>

**3. When must the winding up deposit be paid to the Official Receiver?**<br>

Pursuant to rule 64 of the IRD (Corporate Insolvency and Restructuring) Rules 2020, before filing a winding up application in respect of a company, the applicant must make payment of the prescribed sum to the Official Receiver.<br>

**4. How do I pay the winding up deposit?**<br>

You may pay the winding up deposit via bank transfer or PayNow to the Official Receiver’s account. Please email [FINANCE@mlaw.gov.sg](mailto:FINANCE@mlaw.gov.sg) to request for our bank account details and the Deposit Form. <br>
<br>
An Official Receipt will be issued via email to you within 4 working days upon receiving the completed Deposit Form. You are required to exhibit the Official Receipt as part of your winding up application.<br>

**7. How do I apply for an early dissolution of a company?**<br>

You should submit a report to the Official Receiver, detailing the assets realised (if any) and a final account summarising the receipts and payments in the course of administration. The report should also include your assessment on why the realisable assets are insufficient to cover the expenses of liquidation; and whether the affairs of the company require any further investigations.<br>
