<h2>Information on Outstanding Assets of a Defunct Company</h2>
<p>A company becomes defunct after it is either dissolved or struck off from
the Register by the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority.</p>
<p><strong>What is the role of the Official Receiver?</strong>
<br>Where there are outstanding assets belonging to a defunct company, these
are vested in the Official Receiver under section 213 of the Insolvency,
Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018. The Official Receiver will then
act as a representative of the defunct company to administer and/or dispose
of these assets under sections 212 and 216 of the Insolvency, Restructuring
and Dissolution Act 2018.</p>
<p>The Official Receiver may represent the company, if it is proven to his
satisfaction under section 212(1) of the Insolvency, Restructuring and
Dissolution Act 2018 that:</p>
<p>(i) the company, if still existing, would be legally or equitably bound
to carry out, complete or give effect to some dealing, transaction or matter;
and</p>
<p>(ii) in order to carry out, complete or give effect to the said dealing,
transaction or matter, some purely administrative act should have been
done or should be done by or on behalf of the company, if still existing.
