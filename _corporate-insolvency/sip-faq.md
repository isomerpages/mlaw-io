SIMPLIFIED INSOLVENCY PROGRAMME FAQ
---
**QUESTIONS & ANSWERS** 

**THE SIMPLIFIED INSOLVENCY PROGRAMME UNDER THE INSOLVENCY, RESTRUCTURING AND DISSOLUTION (AMENDMENT) ACT 2020**<br>
<BR>

*BACKGROUND*

**1. What is the Simplified Insolvency Programme (“SIP”)**<br>

The SIP aims to provide simpler, faster, and lower-cost proceedings to assist micro and small companies in need of winding up or restructuring. The SIP comprises two separate programmes:<br>
   a) **Simplified Debt Restructuring Programme ("SDRP")** - Restructuring debts and potential rehabilitation of viable businesses; and <br>
   b) **Simplified Winding Up Programme** - Orderly winding up of non-viable businesses.<br> 
   
   For a company under SDRP, the Restructuring Advisor acts as a single point of contact in dealing with multiple classes of creditors to i) develop a restructuring plan, ii) co-ordinate with the creditors to vote on the restructuring plan and iii) have the Court sanction the restructuring plan.<br>
   
   For a company with only 1 or 2 major creditor(s), it will be more cost-effective for the company to approach the major creditor(s) directly to negotiate a debt restructuring plan.
 <br>
   
**2. Why is there a need for the Simplified Insolvency Programme (“SIP”)?**<br>

The SIP seeks to provide simpler, faster, and lower-cost proceedings to assist micro and small companies which may be unlikely to have the resources to attempt to wind up or restructure their debts on their own. <br>

**3. When will the Simplified Insolvency Programme (“SIP”) commence?**<br>

The SIP will start on 29 Jan 2021.<br>
<br>
<br>
*APPLICATION - GENERAL* <br>

**4. How can a company apply for the Simplified Insolvency Programme (“SIP”)?**<br>

A company may apply for the SIP by submitting an online application, together with the required documents and information, via the MinLaw website at <a href="https://eservices.mlaw.gov.sg/io/">https://eservices.mlaw.gov.sg/io/</a><br>
<br>
Before submitting an application, please refer to the following applicable guides:<br>
   (a) <a href="https://io.mlaw.gov.sg/files/Guide%20to%20SDRP%20Appln.pdf">Simplified Debt Restructuring Programme</a> <br>
   (b) <a href="https://io.mlaw.gov.sg/files/Guide%20to%20SWUP%20Appln.pdf">Simplified Winding Up Programme</a> <br>

**5. Can a company apply for both the Simplified Debt Restructuring Programme (“SDRP”) and the Simplified Winding Up Programme (“SWUP”) at the same time?**<br>

No, a company may submit only one application at a time for either programme. For example, if a company has submitted an application for the SDRP, the company should not submit an application for the SWUP until it has been assessed to be unsuitable for the former. The company may then make a fresh application for the SWUP. <br>

**6. Will the creditors of a company be able to use the Simplified Insolvency Programme (“SIP”) to restructure the debts of the debtor company or to wind up the debtor company?**<br>

No, an application for the SIP is only open to applications from the company.  

**7. Are foreign companies eligible for the Simplified Insolvency Programme (“SIP”)?**<br>

The intent behind the SIP is to assist locally incorporated micro and small companies (“MSCs”) to restructure or wind up if they meet the statutory eligibility criteria. As the SIP is supported by limited public resources, non-locally incorporated, i.e. foreign MSCs will not be eligible for the SIP. Moreover, the restructuring or winding up of a foreign MSC (with assets and creditors overseas) is likely to render it unsuitable for the simplified processes of the SIP.<br>

**8. Are foreign-owned companies which are incorporated in Singapore eligible for the Simplified Insolvency Programme (“SIP”)?**<br>

A company which is incorporated in Singapore will be eligible for the SIP if they also fulfil the statutory eligibility criteria for acceptance.  This is regardless of the fact that the company is foreign-owned.<br>

**9. What are the applicable fees and charges payable under the Simplified Insolvency Programme (“SIP”)?**<br>

The Applicant Company (“AC”) is required to pay to the Official Receiver ("OR") (a) an application fee of $450 upon application, and (b) an administrative fee of $18,750 or $2,700 (as the case may be) upon acceptance into the Simplified Debt Restructuring Programme (“SDRP”) and Simplified Winding Up Programme (“SWUP”), respectively.<br>

The other fees and charges may be payable by the AC after it is accepted into the SIP includes:<br>
(a)	Cost of obtaining legal advice on matters concerning the applicant company; <br>
(b)	Cost of publishing gazettes; <br>
(c)	Cost of making an application to the Court for sanction of the proposed scheme.<br>

These fees will be paid directly by the AC to the service provider they have engaged.<br>

The fee structure is summarised in the table below:  <br>

ACs are advised to seek the assistance of the company accountant or finance personnel to complete the templates for the 90-day cashflow projection and 24-month projected Profit & Loss Statement.<br>
<br>

*ASSESSMENT OF APPLICATION - SIMPLIFIED DEBT RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMME*<br>
 
**15. If the Applicant Company’s (“AC”) application is assessed to have fulfilled the eligibility criteria and meets the requirements for acceptance into the Simplified Debt Restructuring Programme (“SDRP”), what happens next?**<br>

A Qualified Person (“QP”) appointed by the Official Receiver (“OR”) will assess whether the AC and its debts have a reasonable prospect of being successfully restructured based on the AC’s Business Plan and supporting documents submitted in the application. At the same time, the OR sends a Notice of Application to the AC and its creditor(s) and publishes the Notice of Application on MinLaw’s website.<br>

If the QP assesses the AC to have fulfilled the eligibility criteria, and is suitable for the SDRP, and if the OR receives no objections to the AC’s application for the SDRP from the AC’s creditors, the AC will be required to pay a deposit of $18,750, towards the administration fee, to the OR.<br>

Upon payment of the deposit of $18,750, a Notice of Acceptance is published on the MinLaw website, notifying the creditors of the company of the AC’s acceptance into the SDRP.<br>

**16. What happens after the Applicant Company (“AC”) is accepted into the Simplified Debt Restructuring Programme (“SDRP”)?**<br>

The appointed Restructuring Advisor (“RA”) will work with, and assist the AC in:<br>
(a) Formulating a proposed scheme of arrangement between the AC and its creditors. If the RA is of the view that the Business Plan is feasible and merits consideration by the creditors, the RA will obtain the agreement of a majority of at least two-thirds in value of the creditors; and<br>
(b) Making an application to the Court for the sanction of the proposed scheme of arrangement. The AC may also engage a lawyer at its own cost to work with and assist the RA with the application to the Court.<br>

**17. Who are the Qualified Persons (“QP”) and Restructuring Advisors (“RA”) appointed by the Official Receiver (“OR”)?**<br>

The QPs and RAs appointed by the OR are a panel of licensed insolvency practitioners who are professional public accountants and chartered accountants. <br>

**18. How long will the Simplified Debt Restructuring Programme (“SDRP”) take?**<br>

Upon acceptance into the SDRP, the entire process must be completed within a default period of *90 days* from the published date of the Notice of Acceptance. The default period of 90 days can vary depending on whether it is extended by the Official Receiver (the extension may only be made once), or when the AC’s application on the proposed scheme of arrangement is granted or dismissed by the Court, or withdrawn.<br>
<br>

*COST OF APPLICATION - SIMPLIFIED DEBT RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMME*<br>

**19. Apart from the application fee of $450 and administration fee of $18,750 paid by the Applicant Company (“AC”), what other costs and expenses can the AC expect to incur for the Simplified Debt Restructuring Programme (“SDRP”)?**<br>

The AC will be required to bear the costs and expenses incurred in the course of administration of the SDRP. Examples of such costs and expenses are:<br>
a) Cost of obtaining legal advice on matters concerning the AC<br>
b) Cost of publishing the required notices in the Gazette<br>
c) Cost of making an application to the Court for sanction of the proposed scheme of arrangement<br>

Apart from the cost of publishing the required notices in the Gazette, other costs and expenses are to be agreed to between the AC and the vendor(s), and paid directly by the AC to them. The appointed Restructuring Advisor will obtain the AC’s prior consent before incurring any cost and expenses.<br>

**20. Are there any subsidies for the Restructuring Advisor’s (“RA”) fees?**

The deposit of $18,750 paid by the AC, towards the administration fee, takes into account an average government subsidy of 25% for companies admitted into the Simplified Debt Restructuring Programme ("SDRP").<br>
<br> 
The SDRP is a simplified version of the existing debt restructuring tools in the market (i.e. Judicial Managements and Schemes of Arrangement). Under the SDRP, the RA is intended to act as a single point of contact in dealing with multiple creditors to i) develop a restructuring plan, ii) co-ordinate with the creditors to vote on the restructuring plan and iii) have the Court sanction the restructuring plan. <br>   
<br>
*TAX IMPLICATIONS - SIMPLIFIED DEBT RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMME*<br>

**21. Are there any tax implications or benefits under the Simplified Debt Restructuring Programme (“SDRP”)?**<br>

Applicant Companies("AC") that  successfully restructure their debts under the SDRP will have the forgiven amounts* written back as revenue. Taking into consideration the purpose of SDRP, debts forgiven (including trade debts and loans) under the SDRP will be regarded as capital in nature and hence not subject to income tax. ACs can refer to <a href="https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/COVID-19-Support-Measures-and-Tax-Guidance/Tax-Guidance/For-Businesses/Tax-Treatment-of-Debts-Forgiven-under-MinLaw-s-Simplified-Debt-Restructuring-Programme/">IRAS website</a> for more information on the tax treatment.<br> 

<i>* Forgiven amounts are those owed to the creditors of the AC which have been waived off under the SDRP.</i><br>

The broad differences are:<br>
(a) The simplified winding up does not require an application to Court. The process begins with an application by the Applicant Company (“AC”) to the Official Receiver (“OR”) to be wound up voluntarily upon being accepted into the SWUP.<br>
(b) The OR is the liquidator of the AC accepted into the SWUP.<br>
(c) The scope of the liquidator’s functions in under the simplified winding up will be reduced given the profile of the companies in the SWUP, as certain complex and costly aspects of a conventional winding up are not applicable in the simplified process.<br>

In cases which involve the realisation of assets, the AC will be placed into dissolution *within one year* of being accepted into the SWUP, subject to the circumstances of the case and the complexity involved in realising the assets under administration. <br>
<br>

*FEES PAYABLE - SIMPLIFIED WINDING UP PROGRAMME*<br>

**28. Apart from the application fee of $450 and the administration fee of $2,700 paid by the Applicant Company (“AC”), what other fees are involved in the winding up of a company under the programme?**<br>

**30. How will the creditors of the Applicant Company (“AC”) be paid?**<br>

Upon the realisation of the assets of the AC and upon the assessment that there are surplus monies available for distribution as dividends to creditors of the AC, the Official Receiver (“OR”) puts up a Notice of Intended Dividend to invite creditors to file their Proofs of Debt with the OR. After the expiry of the Notice of Intended Dividend, the Proofs of Debt filed with the OR are adjudicated and dividends shall be declared and paid to the creditors of the admitted claims via GIRO (for local creditors) or telegraphic transfers (for foreign creditors).<br>
<br>

*GST REQUIREMENTS - SIMPLIFIED WINDING UP PROGRAMME*<br>

**31. Are GST-registered companies required to apply for deregistration from GST before applying for the Simplified Winding Up Programme (“SWUP”)?**<br>
