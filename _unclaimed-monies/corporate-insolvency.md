<h2>Unclaimed Monies</h2>
<p>In all winding ups, any unclaimed dividends or other monies which remain
unclaimed for more than six months from the date when they became payable
and any unclaimed or undistributed monies after the final distribution
shall be placed in the Companies Liquidation Account. Claimants may apply
to the Official Receiver for the monies to be paid to them.</p>
<p>All unclaimed dividends and monies paid to the Official Receiver are transferred
to the Consolidated Fund after 7 years unless a claim is made. A claimant
may, at any time, make an application for the monies even after they are
paid into the Consolidated Fund.</p>
