Unclaimed Monies
---

In all winding ups, any unclaimed dividends or other monies which remain unclaimed for more than six months from the date when they became payable and any unclaimed or undistributed monies after the final distribution shall be placed in the Companies Liquidation Account. Claimants may apply to the Official Receiver for the monies to be paid to them.

All unclaimed dividends and monies paid to the Official Receiver are transferred to the Consolidated Fund after 7 years unless a claim is made. A claimant may, at any time, make an application for the monies even after they are paid into the Consolidated Fund.
