<p>The Ministry of Law has been alerted to a case involving the falsification
of a notice purportedly issued by the Insolvency &amp; Public Trustee’s
Office. In this case, a notice of bankruptcy orders was doctored to show
that a bankruptcy order had been made against an individual, who was then
pressured to make payment. The individual notified MinLaw about the matter,
and a police report has been made.</p>
<p>Recipients of such suspicious notices should exercise caution in engaging
the sender of such notices. MinLaw will not send such notices to individuals.
If in doubt about the authenticity of any notice, please contact MinLaw
via the online enquiry form at <a href="https://www.go.gov.sg/contactminlaw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.go.gov.sg/contactminlaw</a> or
call the MinLaw hotline at 1800 2255 529.</p>
<p>For scam-related advice, please call the National Crime Prevention Council’s
ScamShield helpline at 1799 or visit <a href="https://www.scamshield.gov.sg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">www.scamshield.gov.sg</a>.</p>
