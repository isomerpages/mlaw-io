<h2>Pre-Bankruptcy </h2>
<h3><u>Alternatives to Bankruptcy</u></h3>
<p><strong>1. Advice for Debtors </strong>
<br>Do not ignore your creditors' Letters of Demand, Statutory Demands, or
Writs of summons from the Court. You can be made a bankrupt even if you
refuse to respond to your creditors or decline to accept service of their
documents.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>2. Reasons to avoid bankruptcy </strong>
<br>Difficulties in looking for a job
<br>Restrictions in traveling overseas
<br>Restrictions in obtaining credit greater than $1,000
<br>Restrictions in managing a business or acting as a director of a company
<br>No automatic discharge from bankruptcy in Singapore
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>3. Advice for creditors </strong>
<br>Commencing bankruptcy proceedings will not guarantee the full recovery
of the debts owed. You should only commence bankruptcy proceedings against
your debtor when all other debt recovery options have been exhausted.
<br>
</p>
<p>Other reasons to consider before commencing bankruptcy proceedings:
<br>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The cost of bankruptcy proceedings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The loss of interest on the principal sum owed after the making of the
Bankruptcy Order</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The low likelihood of recovering debts in full</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the bankrupt’s discharge from bankruptcy, debts which are not fully
settled will be extinguished and creditors will not be able to further
pursue the debts. (There are certain types of debts which will not be extinguished
e.g. Debts owed to the Singapore Government that remain unpaid will not
be extinguished even after the bankrupt’s discharge from bankruptcy.)
<br>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Private Arrangement </strong>
<br>Debtors may enter into a private arrangement with creditors to pay off
their debts in instalments or in scheduled repayments. Debtors can also
request for an extension of time to liquidate their assets to repay their
debts.
<br>
</p>
<p>Debtors should inform creditors of their latest financial position. They
should provide information and documentary evidence truthfully and completely
to prove their current financial position.
<br>
</p>
<p>Debtors should make serious effort in keeping up with their repayment
after entering into the arrangement.
<br>

<p><strong>6. Voluntary Arrangement </strong>
<br>Debtors may apply to Court for an interim order for a Voluntary Arrangement
(VA). The VA is a negotiated debt settlement under Part V of the Bankruptcy
Act. The debtor discloses his assets and liabilities, and makes a proposal
on how he intends to settle his debts with various creditors. If the proposal
is accepted by the creditors and implemented successfully, it will benefit
both the debtor and his creditors.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>7. Court Dispute Resolution </strong>
<br>If you are a debtor being sued by your creditor under civil proceedings,
you may negotiate for a settlement of the repayment of your debts and avoid
bankruptcy.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>8. Oral Legal Advice </strong>
<br>The information provided above on bankruptcy matters is by no means exhaustive.
You may wish to consult your solicitor before making any decision concerning
bankruptcy. If you are unable to afford a solicitor, you may obtain legal
advice from the Legal Aid Bureau ("LAB"). For more information, please

<br>
</p>
<p><strong>9. Debt Repayment Scheme </strong>
<br>The Debt Repayment Scheme (DRS) is a repayment scheme to assist debtors
who have a regular income and debts not exceeding $150,000, to avoid bankruptcy.
<br>
</p>
<p>The DRS is triggered by a bankruptcy application. When such an application
is made to the High Court and the debt owed does not exceed S$150,000,
the High Court may refer the debtor to the Official Assignee for an assessment
of the debtor’s eligibility and suitability to enter into the DRS. If the
debtor satisfies the relevant criteria, an administrator will devise a
repayment plan requiring regular debt repayments to the creditors over
a fixed period of time. Debtors who do not comply with the conditions of
the scheme will be failed from the DRS. These debtors may subsequently
face another bankruptcy application filed against them and be made bankrupt
by the High Court.
<br>
</p>
