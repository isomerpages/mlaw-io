<h4><strong>General Information on Bankruptcy</strong></h4>
<p><strong>1. How does a debtor become a bankrupt?</strong>
<br>A Bankruptcy Application is filed in the High Court by either the debtor
or a creditor. The debtor owes debts of at least $15,000 which he cannot
repay. The High Court may then declare him a bankrupt at the court hearing.</p>
<p><strong>2. Debtor’s own application for bankruptcy</strong>
<br>Applying for one’s bankruptcy should not be viewed as an easy solution
to one’s debt woes. Debtors should look for alternative solutions to settle
their debts before considering applying for their own bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Debtors may wish to refer to <a href="https://io.mlaw.gov.sg/bankruptcy/applyingforbankruptcy/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://io.mlaw.gov.sg/bankruptcy/applyingforbankruptcy/</a> to
view the guide for a debtor application procedure in general or refer to
the Supreme Court’s website <a href="https://www.judiciary.gov.sg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.judiciary.gov.sg/</a> for
further details on bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
<p><strong>3. Creditor’s application for bankruptcy</strong>
<br>Commencing bankruptcy proceedings will not guarantee the full recovery
of the debts owed. You should only commence bankruptcy proceedings against
your debtor when all other debt recovery options have been exhausted.</p>
<p>Creditors may wish to refer to <a href="https://io.mlaw.gov.sg/bankruptcy/applyingforbankruptcy/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://io.mlaw.gov.sg/bankruptcy/applyingforbankruptcy/</a> to
view the guide for a creditor application procedure in general or refer
to the Supreme Court’s website&nbsp;<a href="https://www.judiciary.gov.sg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.judiciary.gov.sg/</a> for
further details on bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
<p><strong>4. Are there other costs involved in filing a bankruptcy application?</strong>
<br>Any creditor or debtor who wishes to file a Bankruptcy Application in
the High Court must pay a deposit of $1,850 to the Official Assignee for
the administration of the bankrupt’s estate. The creditor applying for
the bankruptcy may recover this deposit if there are sufficient funds in
the bankrupt’s estate. The deposit of $1,850 will not be refunded to a
bankrupt who has applied for his own bankruptcy.</p>
<p>If the Bankruptcy Application is dismissed by the High Court or if it
is withdrawn, the Official Assignee will retain $50 as preliminary administration
costs under the Bankruptcy (Fees) Rules and refund $1,800 to the applicant
who has filed the bankruptcy application.</p>
<p>With effect from 5 Mar 2018, all payments will be made electronically.</p>
