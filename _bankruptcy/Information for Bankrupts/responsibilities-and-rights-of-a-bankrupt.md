Duties and Responsibilities of a Bankrupt
---

<b>1. Contributions to Bankruptcy Estate</b><br>

<b>(a) Must I contribute any income to my bankruptcy estate?</b> <br>
If you are gainfully employed, you must make a monthly contribution to your bankruptcy estate for the benefit of your creditors. The contributions will be accumulated in your bankruptcy estate and will be distributed to your creditors upon your discharge from bankruptcy. <br>

The amount and the frequency of payments you make to your bankruptcy estate is an important factor considered by the Official Assignee when reviewing your case to determine your suitability for discharge from bankruptcy. <br>

 

<b>(b) How much do I have to contribute my bankruptcy estate?</b> <br>
The Official Assignee will assess the amount which you will be required to pay each month after taking into account what you reasonably need for yourself and your family. <br>

You will be required to submit your Income Declaration declaring information on your occupation, income and list of dependants when you attend the Official Assignee’s office to file your Statement of Affairs. You will also need to update this information online by filing your Statement of Monies and Properties received every six months. <br>

 

<b>(c) What are the payment modes for my monthly instalment payments?</b><br>
You can make your monthly instalment payments [online](https://go.gov.sg/ecp) [(https://go.gov.sg/ecp)](https://go.gov.sg/ecp) and through GIRO. <br>

<b>2. Travelling Overseas</b> <br>

<b>(a) Can I travel overseas? </b> <br>
You are allowed to leave Singapore or remain overseas after obtaining the approval of the Official Assignee.

<b>(b) How do I apply for permission to travel overseas?</b><br>
If you wish to leave Singapore, you should apply online at least 14 days before your departure date to obtain the Official Assignee’s permission, stating the reason for your travel, your destination of travel and your period of travel.<br>

You will also need to submit documents in respect of your travel application if required by the Official Assignee. For example, if you are travelling for employment purposes, you need to submit your letter of employment or a company letter supporting the reason for your travel.

<b>(c) What if I need to travel urgently?</b> <br>
If you need to travel urgently, you are still required to apply for permission [online](https://go.gov.sg/bankruptcy ) and thereafter contact your officer to obtain confirmation on the approval status of your travel application. <br>

<b>(d) What if I need to travel frequently?</b> <br>
If you have to travel frequently, you may apply for block periods of travel subject to your conduct in bankruptcy. <br>

**ii.**     Act as director or take part in or to be concerned in the management of any corporation (Singapore or foreign company) under the Companies Act (Chapter 50).

 

<b>(b) How can I apply to manage a business or corporation?</b> <br>

If your bankruptcy is administered by the Official Assignee, please submit your application electronically through the Insolvent Person’s portal in [https://go.gov.sg/bankruptcy](https://go.gov.sg/bankruptcy).

<b>(c) What are the factors taken into consideration when reviewing my application to manage a business or corporation?</b> <br>
Each application will be considered on its own merit. The Official Assignee will take into consideration a number of factors including:

* your conduct before and during bankruptcy;
* your previous involvement in the business or corporation;
* the nature and viability of the proposed business or corporation;
* the nature of your involvement in the business or corporation;
