<h4><strong>Advisory on seeking permission of the Official Assignee/Private-Trustee-in-Bankruptcy to leave, remain or reside outside Singapore</strong></h4>
<p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please be reminded
that as an undischarged bankrupt, you are legally required to obtain the
previous permission of the Official Assignee (“OA”) or the Private Trustee-In-Bankruptcy
(“PTIB”), as the case may be, before you can leave, remain or reside outside
Singapore, regardless of whether this is for employment or otherwise. Departing
Singapore or attempting to do so, without such previous permission, is
an offence punishable by law.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To avoid any disruption
to your travel plans or employment, you are strongly advised to take all
necessary steps to ensure that you have obtained the requisite permission
before your departure. In this regard, you must submit your application
with supporting documents to obtain the requisite permission electronically
via the Insolvent Person’s Portal hosted at <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/eservices/io/</a> before
your intended date of departure from Singapore. To ensure that your application
can be processed in time, you are strongly advised to make the submission
at least 14 days before the intended date of departure.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>TAKE NOTE</strong> that
you <u>will not be allowed to depart from Singapore</u> without the previous
permission of the OA or the PTIB, as the case may be.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please note that
any last-minute application for such permission after you have been prevented
from departing Singapore from an immigration checkpoint will not be entertained.</p>
